## Overview

It is a Java-based 2D game project that combines the excitement of the Dragon Balls Game with the convenience of Google Sign-In functionality. This project offers an engaging gaming experience while providing users with the option to log in or create a new user account using Google Sign-In or a custom sign-in mechanism.


## Key Features:

1. **Dragon Balls Game:** The core of this project is the Dragon Balls Game, a 2D game where players control a rectangle to reflect moving balls. The game features multiple levels, dynamic ball movement, and interactive gameplay.

2. **Google Sign-In Integration:** Users have the choice to log in using their Google accounts, leveraging Google's authentication system. This integration simplifies the login process for users and enhances security with proper verification.

3. **Custom Sign-In Option:** In addition to Google Sign-In, the project includes a custom sign-in option. Users can create new accounts without using Google Sign-In if they prefer.

4. **User Authentication:** Upon successful Google Sign-In, the project retrieves user information, including their email and name, to personalize the gaming experience.

5. **Welcome Message:** Users are greeted with a welcome message displaying their name and email address after signing in.

6. **Game Launch:** Authenticated users can easily launch the Dragon Balls Game by clicking a button. The game opens in a separate window for uninterrupted gameplay.

7. **Score System:** The game keeps track of the player's score and displays it on the side panel. Players earn points for bouncing balls and lose points if a ball reaches the top

8. **Key Controls:** Players can control the rectangular character using the keyboard arrow keys.

9. **Menu Bar:** A Jmenu bar with contents like "Help, Contact/support and Contribute" to guide the users

10. **More features are yet to be updated (Example:  send welcome emails to new users )**



This project demonstrates the seamless integration of Google Sign-In into a Java-based gaming application. It showcases my proficiency in authentication mechanisms and user interaction within Java applications, offering both entertainment and convenience to users.
